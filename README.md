## Overview
This project is an educational tool designed to teach 4th and 5th graders about **IoT (Internet of Things)** and **Gas Safety**. It uses an ESP8266 microcontroller to detect gas levels and a beautiful Flutter app to monitor them in real-time.

**Key Features:**
*   **Universal App**: Works with ANY Firebase project (no coding needed!).
*   **Real-time Dashboard**: See gas levels instantly.
*   **Weekly Reports**: Track air quality over time.
*   **Smart Alerts**: Get pop-up warnings if gas is detected.

## 📂 Project Structure
*   `lib/` - The Flutter Application code.
*   `firmware/` - The C++ code for the ESP8266 microcontroller.
*   `USER_GUIDE.md` - **START HERE!** Detailed instructions on setup.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1.  **Hardware**: Flash the code in `firmware/` to your ESP8266.
2.  **Firebase**: Create a free project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com).
3.  **App**:
    *   Install Flutter.
